# Brain_Tumor_Detection_using-_CNN
I have Used the CNN(Convolutional Neural Networks) Algorithm to detect whether the MRI of a Pateint's Brain Consists of a Tumor or not.
At the last i have also provided a GUI where one can easily identify the brain tumor thorugh their eyes as well.
CNN) is a special form of the artificial neural network, which is a type of feedforward
neural network that includes convolution calculations 35 and has a deep network
structure. It is one of the representative algorithms of deep learning. The research on
convolutional neural networks began in the 1980s and 1990s. Time delay networks and
LeNet-5 are the earliest convolutional neural networks. After the 21st century, with the
introduction of deep learning theory and the improvement of numerical computing
equipment, especially with the use of powerful GPUs, convolutional neural networks
have developed rapidly and have been applied to computer vision and natural language
processing. The convolutional neural network has long been one of the core algorithms
in the field of image recognition, and it has a stable performance when the learning data
is sufficient. A convolutional neural network is a special structure of multilayer
perceptron. Generally, the multilayer perceptron is a fully connected network. Fully
connected means that every neuron in one layer is connected to all neurons in the next
layer.
